# UNet Tensorflow 2
## Semantic Segmentation of Cellular Nuclei
>* Dataset used in Kaggle's Data Science Bowl 2018 "Nuclei Segmentation"
>* The model architecture is the U-Net proposed by Olaf Ronneberger et al. [1] for biomedical image segmentation.
> The original code is from Bengaluru, Karnatak  [2] (based on an U-net starter - LB 0.277 by Kjetil Åmdal-Sævik)
